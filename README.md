- 👋 Hi, I’m @ArthurQuerido, I'm studying Computer Engineering at Universidade Federal de Uberlândia, in Brazil.

- 👀 I’m interested in learning new programming skills and improving everything that I already know.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Python, and improving some other things that I know relatively well, like Photoshop,
Ilustrator and Excel.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can impact the world and help people on a daily basis. 
I want to help the world to be a better place for everyone!

- 📫 You can reach me through mail, on arthur_ql@hotmail.com, or here, but have in mind that on mail I will answer quickly.

  
  See you around ;)
